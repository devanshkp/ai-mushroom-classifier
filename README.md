## Overview

The AI Mushroom Classifier is a full-stack application designed to make mushroom identification more accessible. It combines a user-friendly React frontend with a powerful Flask backend that serves predictions from a TensorFlow/Keras Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This tool aims to provide quick, AI-driven insights into 100 different mushroom species based on visual data.

## 🧠 Model Training & Performance

The core of this application is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for image classification:

-   **Model Architecture:** Built using TensorFlow/Keras, leveraging transfer learning with MobileNetV2 as the base model, followed by custom layers (GlobalAveragePooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dense, Dropout).
-   **Dataset:** Trained on a dataset of mushroom images covering **100 different species**. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thehir0/mushroom-species/code)
-   **Training Techniques:**
    -   Data Augmentation (RandomFlip, RandomRotation, RandomZoom) to improve model generalization.
    -   Callbacks like `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, and `ModelCheckpoint` were used for efficient training.
    -   Fine-tuning of the later layers of the pre-trained MobileNetV2.
-   **Performance:** Achieved approximately **80% accuracy** on the test set for classifying 100 distinct mushroom species.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

1.  **React Frontend:** Handles user interactions, image uploads, and presentation of results.
2.  **Flask Backend API:**
    -   Receives image data from the frontend.
    -   Preprocesses the image (resize, normalize) using Pillow and NumPy.
    -   Feeds the processed image to the loaded TensorFlow/Keras model.
    -   Returns the top N predictions (label, confidence) as a JSON response.
3.  **TensorFlow/Keras Model:** The pre-trained `.keras` file containing the learned weights for mushroom classification.

## 🚀 Local Setup & Installation

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Python (3.12.10 recommended, or a compatible 3.x version)
-   pip 
-   Node.js
-   npm (or yarn)

### 1. Clone Repository

Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devanshkp/ai-mushroom-classifier
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Flask & AI Model)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

    Execute the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv

    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    Once the virtual environment has been activated, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Place Model and Class Names:**
    -   Ensure your trained model file (e.g., `mushroom.keras`) is placed inside the `model` sub-directory within the `backend` folder: `backend/model/mushroom.keras`.
    -   Ensure your `class_names.json` file is placed directly inside the `backend` folder: `backend/class_names.json`.
    -   **Important:** Your Flask `app.py` code should reference these files with paths relative to `app.py`. For example, if `app.py` is in the `backend` folder:

        ```python
        # In backend/app.py
        with open('class_names.json', 'r') as f: # Correct relative path
            class_names = json.load(f)
        model = keras.models.load_model('model/mushroom.keras') # Correct relative path
        ```

5.  **Run the Flask backend server:**

    Run `app.py` python file.

    The backend should now be running, by default on `http://localhost:5000` unless changed.

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory (from the project root):**

    Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    Execute the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    *(Or `yarn install` if you are using Yarn)*

3.  **Verify API Endpoint:**
    Ensure the `Workspace` URL in your React component (e.g., `src/Home.js` or `src/App.js`) points to your local Flask backend:
    ```javascript
    // For example in Home.jsx
    const res = await fetch("http://localhost:5000/predict", { /* ... */ });
    ```

4.  **Run the React frontend development server:**

    Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    *(Or `yarn dev` if you are using Yarn)*

    The frontend should now open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### 4. Running the Application

-   Once both backend and frontend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to the react app URL.
-   You should be able to upload an image and see the classification results.
